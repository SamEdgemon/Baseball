<!-- # An Introduction to the Series -->

**Welcome to Baseball Analytics 101 with SAS!**

If you’ve ever wondered what “analytics” really means — or if this is your first time seeing data science in action — you’ve come to the right place.

In this series, we’ll explore the story of baseball through the lens of data. From the early days of box scores to today’s world of high-speed analytics, baseball has always been a game of numbers — measured, debated, and redefined through statistics. Together, we’ll see how data has described baseball’s past and continues to shape its future.

But this series is about more than just baseball — it’s about learning to think and work like a data scientist. You’ll practice the core skills of a data scientist: accessing and querying data, exploring and analyzing it, visualizing results, and ultimately turning raw data into meaningful insights. Along the way, you’ll gain hands-on experience with SAS and SQL, two of the most powerful tools in analytics, while following the workflow that professional analysts use every day.

**How We’ll Work With the Data**

The data we’ll use comes from **Lahman’s Baseball Database**, a comprehensive collection of historical baseball data. You can explore it on your own, but for each exercise, I’ll provide a link to the exact dataset so you can download it and replicate the steps.

I access data in different ways depending on the situation — sometimes from CSV files directly into a programming environment, and other times from SQL-based databases. For this series, we’ll be working with **SQLite**.

We’ll **query the data using SQL**, export the results as CSV files, and then import them into **SAS Workbench**. In SAS, we’ll **process data, perform calculations, create reports, and visualize results** as tables and charts.

Each post will follow a consistent pattern to make learning clear and practical:

- **Explore** baseball history through the stories of innovators, players, and key moments
- **Access** data using SQL queries
- **Process, analyze, and visualize** data using SAS
- **Summarize** what we learned and see how it all comes together in SAS

This approach lets you see the full workflow in action — from accessing data to generating insights — while practicing the foundational skills of a data scientist.

With these tools in hand, you’re ready to follow the workflow, explore the data, and begin your journey as a data scientist.

*So grab your glove, open your laptop, and get ready to step up to the plate. 
Let’s play ball!*
