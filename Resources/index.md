The Tools for the Sports Analytics Series

- **SAS Workbench** is a cloud-based, on-demand coding environment for data scientists and developers to build advanced models. You can access SAS Workbench **[here](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya-workbench-for-learners.html)**

- **Lahman's Baseball Database** The data we’ll use comes from Lahman’s Baseball Database, a comprehensive collection of historical baseball data created by Sean Lahman. It contains complete and extensive major league statistics dating back to 1871. **Extracts from the database will be provided** for each exercise; regardless, the entire database can be downloaded **[here](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/)**

- **SQLite** is a self-contained, serverless, transactional SQL database engine. Like the Lahman Database, it is not necessary to download it for this instructional series, but it can be downloaded **[here](https://sqlite.org/)**
