<!-- # Sports Analytics Series

Learn analytics and data science through the power of sports.

---
-->

<!-- ## Welcome to the Sports Analytics Series -->

**Welcome to the Sports Analytics Series** — a learning experience designed to help you think and work like a data scientist, using the world of sports as your training ground.

If you’ve ever wondered what “analytics” really means — or if this is your first time seeing data science in action — you’re in the right place.

Across this series, we’ll explore how data shapes the way we understand sports:
how games are played, how players evolve, how decisions are made, and how strategies are built.

But this series is about more than sports — it’s about learning the core skills of analytics:

- Accessing and querying data
- Exploring and preparing raw datasets for analytics
- Analyzing and visualizing results
- Turning findings into actionable insights and data stories

Along the way, you’ll gain hands-on experience with tools used every day by analysts and data scientists, 
including **SAS**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **R** while working with real sports datasets and real-world workflows.

## Blog Posts

A series of blogs will be introduced regarding each sport and will reference the history of the game, data extracts from actual sports data,  
- The history, context, and key figures of the game  
- Datasets built from real sports data  
- Exercises using SQL, SAS, Python, or R  
- Visualizations and analytics that bring the numbers to life

## Resources

- **SAS Workbench** is a cloud-based, on-demand coding environment for data scientists and developers to build advanced models. You can access SAS Workbench [here](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya-workbench-for-learners.html).

- **Lahman Baseball Database** was created by Sean Lahman and contains complete and extensive major league statistics dating back to 1871. It is not necessary to download the full database, as extracts will be provided for you; however, it is available for download [here](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/).

- **SQLite** is a self-contained, serverless, transactional SQL database engine. Like the Lahman Database, it is not necessary to download it for this instructional series, but it is available for download [here](https://sqlite.org/).
