<!-- # Sports Analytics Series

Learn analytics and data science through the power of sports.

<!-- ## Welcome to the Sports Analytics Series -->

**Welcome to the Sports Analytics Series** — a learning experience designed to help you think and work like a data scientist, using the world of sports as your training ground.

If you’ve ever wondered what “analytics” really means — or if this is your first time seeing data science in action — you’re in the right place.

Across this series, we’ll explore how data shapes the way we understand sports:
how games are played, how players evolve, how decisions are made, and how strategies are built.

But this series is about more than sports — it’s about learning the core skills of analytics:

- accessing and querying data
- exploring and preparing raw datasets
- analyzing and visualizing results
- turning findings into clear insights and stories

You’ll get hands-on practice using tools such as **SAS, SQL, Python, and R**, working with real sports datasets and real-world workflows.
