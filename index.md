<!-- # Sports Analytics Series

Learn analytics and data science through the power of sports.

---

<!-- ## Welcome to the Sports Analytics Series -->

**Welcome to the Sports Analytics Series** — a learning experience designed to help you think and work like a data scientist, using the world of sports as your training ground.

If you’ve ever wondered what “analytics” really means — or if this is your first time seeing data science in action — you’re in the right place.

Across this series, we’ll explore how data shapes the way we understand sports:
how games are played, how players evolve, how decisions are made, and how strategies are built.

But this series is about more than sports — it’s about learning the core skills of analytics:

- Accessing and querying data
- Exploring and preparing raw datasets for analytics
- Analyzing and visualizing results
- Turning findings into actionable insights and data stories

Along the way, you’ll gain hands-on experience with tools used every day by analysts and data scientists, 
including **SAS**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **R** while working with real sports datasets and real-world workflows.
