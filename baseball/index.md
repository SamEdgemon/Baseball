## Sabermetrics with SAS

In this series, you’ll step into the shoes of a data scientist — exploring baseball history, learning SAS and SQL, and turning raw data into insights. 

Along the way, you will:

- **Discover** baseball history through key players, innovators, and moments
- **Access** and query data from real baseball datasets
- **Analyze** and visualize data with tables, charts, and graphs
- **Practice** a full workflow from raw data to actionable insight

By the end, you’ll have **hands-on experience with SAS** and the foundational skills to think and work like a data scientist.

## The Tools We Use

- **SAS Workbench** is a cloud-based, on-demand coding environment for data scientists and developers to build advanced models. You can access SAS Workbench [here](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya-workbench-for-learners.html).

- **Lahman Baseball Database** was created by Sean Lahman and contains complete and extensive major league statistics dating back to 1871. It is not necessary to download the full database, as extracts will be provided for you; however, it is available for download [here](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/).

- **SQLite** is a self-contained, serverless, transactional SQL database engine. Like the Lahman Database, it is not necessary to download it for this instructional series, but it is available for download [here](https://sqlite.org/).
